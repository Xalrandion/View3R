# View3R

## A 3D environment builder with primitives for prototyping. (ðŸš§ WIP)

### Description 
Though it is itself a prototype, this project ambition is to allow you to quickly prototype 3D scenes using primives and simple materials and textures directly from a VR environment. I only tested it using the Meta quest 2.

### Installation

You can build view3R using unreal engine 5 to try it or you can download it from the release tab.

### Usage

#### Controlls

- Selection / interact with Menu: trigger right
- Edit selection: grab right
- Change focused axis: joystick left (green: Y, red: X: blue: Z)
